					<p class="text-box">The Air Pressure System (APS) plays a vital role in heavy-duty vehicles by utilizing compressed air to apply pressure to the brake pads, enabling the vehicle to slow down. Unlike hydraulic systems, APS offers advantages such as the ready availability and sustainable nature of natural air. The task at hand involves Binary Classification, where one class signifies failures attributed to a specific APS component, while the other class represents failures caused by other factors.<a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/soumenkhatua/APS-fault-detection">View here</a></p>

It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers. Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.<a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/Abdul-Jaweed/Customer-Personality-Analysis">View here</a></p>
